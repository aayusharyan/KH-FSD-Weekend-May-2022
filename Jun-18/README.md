Container Tags.
### div
- This is A GENERIC container.
- The idea/purpose is to divide the complicated HTML into smaller parts.
- Then it becomes easy to manage.
- div can have another div inside it.

### span
- This is a TEXT container.
- This doesn't have style of it's own.
- Mostly used if we want to highlight a part of text.

### input
- Taking some information from the user.
- User is someone who is using our website.
- We are developers.
- We want the input FROM the user.

### Comments
- These are words/text written for humans.
- This is used to explain what the code is doing
- The machine NEVER reads this.

- We are running HTML5.3
- Major change was HTML5 (around 2014-2015).
- Various input types were introduced in HTML5 (such as, email, url, date, time, etc. etc).
- center and marquee were deprecated. Strike tag was deprecated.

### select and option
- This shows a dropdown to the user containing various options from which the user can select
- optgroup -> This allows us to organize and put various options together into multiple groups.

### textarea
- this allows the user to enter multi-line inputs. This is a coupled tag. (This has a separate closing).
- This tag cares about the spacing.

### form
- This is the container for the inputs.
- with the action attribute, we tell the browser where to send the data.
- This will perform the validation and everything.
