1. Basic Intro:
- Aayush, I Senior Engineer based out of India and have 7 years of experience in development and 2 years in training. I do pretty much everythin JS.

2. Logic or Algorithm?
-> Logic to solve something.

3. Why Web Development?
- Things are shifting towards Web.
- Internet Boom.
- Every company needs a website which increases the requirement.
- This is an entry point for new developers.
- HTML, CSS, JS.

4. Why JS?
- For Browsers.
- Mobile Apps
- Servers
- JS on IOT Devices
- Machine Learning
- Blockchain
- Smart devices.

5. Web Browsers - Software
- Chrome -> v8 Engine
- Safari -> LGPLv2.1
- Firefox -> Spidermonkey
- Opera
- Netscape 
- Edge -> V8 Engine (Formerly Internet Explorer -> Chakra)

-> Ask for the IP
-> Request for the Data.
-> Interpret the Source Code (Response from the server).
-> Show the User Experience.
-> Produces the Output.

6. Web 3.0 (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0)
-> Web 1.0 (Read only)
-> Web 2.0 (Read and Write)
-> Web 3.0 (Decentralization)

7. Frontend vs Backend.
-> ReactJS (Frontend) (Alt -> Angular, Vue, Swelt, Next, Gatsby, Nuxt....)
-> NodeJS (Backend) (Alt -> Deno) -> PHP, Python, Go, Scala, Ruby (Non JS)
-> Frontend is what is Executed on the Browser (Client Side). Backend is what is executed on the Server.

8. What is a Programming Language?
-> Programming Language is just like any other language but it is for machines to understand.
-> Humans write code in one or multiple programming languages which the machines understand.

9. Types of Programming Languages
-> High Level Programming Language
--> Human Friendly

```
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
let sum = a + b;
```

--> It has to get converted into Low level.

-> Low Level Programming Language (Assembly, C)
--> Machine Friendly

10. Conversion of High Level to Low Level

-> Compilation (Java, C++, C)
--> Take the whole file and try to give the low level of that file as a WHOLE.
--> Once the low level code is created, then that code can be executed multiple times.
Cons
--> If there is an error, compilation will not happen.


-> Interpretation (JS, Python)
--> Reads the file LINE BY LINE
--> This will run (in case of an error, at least partial execution will happen.)


11. Pseudo Code
--> Fake Code
--> This is written for other humans to understand.
--> This is language agnostic (No limitation... Any language can be used).
Example:
Join the Class at []
Stay for 4 hours
Ask doubts
Leave

12. What is a Program?
-> A series of instruction (set of steps) to solve the given problem.
-> This can be in any language.

13. What is an instruction?
-> A single step of a program / algorithm.
-> This is the most basic task which cannot be broken down further.

Software -> Collection of Programs -> Collection of Instructions -> Instruction.

	    1. If yes, then take the car.
	    2. If no, then walk to that place.
  b. If no, then ask for another suggestion.


Nesting of conditionals -> Putting 1 if inside another if condition.


14. Flow Chart
-> This is a way to represent an algorithm but using diagram.

15. Loop -> Something on Repeat.

Going Grocery Shopping
1. Prepare the List
2. Go to the store
3. Start from first item from the list.
4. Check the item from the list.

16. Function (Task) which we can define
-> This is a block of code which is separated.
-> Set of instructions doing a particular task are put together in a function.
-> This function can be called multiple times from multiple places of your program.
-> This reduces the code and makes it more clean and easy to maintain.


You are an HR, you need to confirm the availability of your employees in order to schedule a meeting, use function.
