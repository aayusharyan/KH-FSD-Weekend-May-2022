## text-align
- Align the text according to the need. (left, right, center, justify).

## RTL and LTR languages
- Right to Left
- Left to Right
- Because of this, instead of using left and right. We should use start and end properties.
LTR -> Start is left and end is right
RTL -> Start is right and end if left

## inheritance
- Inherit the property from it's closest ancestor which has that property.

## display: none;
- This will hide the element. The element will NOT be removed from the HTML, but it will be removed (not shown) on the viewport.

## display: block;
- It will by default, take the whole width.
- It will BLOCK the line, that means, next element will go to the next line. That means, even if we change the width, it will still be blocking, next element goes in the next line.

## display: inline;
- It will take width of the content inside. That means, we CANNOT customize the width.
- It will ALLOW other elements to be on the same line.

         items in the same line, Custom width
inline: ✔️, ❌
block: ❌, ✔️
inline-block: ✔️, ✔️

## dispaly: inline-block;
- This allows items to be in the same line. (good thing from inline).
- This allows customization of width and height. (good thing from block).

- RGB we write using rgb(100, 150, 200);
- HEX is the decimal red, green and blue, converted into hexadecimal.
