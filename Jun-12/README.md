Website is made of 3 primary components.
HTML / CSS / JS

HTML gives the structure
CSS gives the looks
JS gives the functionality.

IDE
-> Integrated Development environment
--> This is like a very powerful notepad for Software development.

Hypertext Markup Language -> Used to structure the content.

Tags
<>
</>

<p>Hey everyone</p>

Opening Tag -> <p>
Closing Tag -> </p>
Content -> Hey Everyone


### Paragraph <p>
--> This shows the content in a paragraph format

### heading <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
--> This shows the heading text.
--> h1 is the largest and h6 is the smallest.

### html tag <html>
--> All the HTML content we write should be inside this.

<html> 
  <p>shfkjshfsf</p>
  <h1>kjsdfjksfjkhd</h1>
</html>

üëÜüèª - this is nesting of tags.

### button <button>
--> This is a button with which the user can interact.

### break <br />
--> This gives a line break.
--> This is a self closing tag.

### Horizontal Rule <hr />
--> 

### Self Closing Tags
--> These type of tags don't need a separate closing tag. (Singular Tags)

### Regular Tags
--> They have separate closing. (Paired Tags)

## HTML doesn't care about casing. However, it is recommended to write in all lower case.
<button></BUTTON>
<BuTtOn></bUtToN>

### head <head>
--> This has the content which is NOT shown in the browser.

### body <body>
--> This has the content that is shown in the browser.

### title <title>
--> Used to show the title of the webpage.

Task -> Create your about me page with these tags.

## Lists
--> To show some data in a list format.

### Unordered List <ul>
--> There is no ordering
--> There is no rank
--> There is no ID.

### Ordered List <ol>
--> There is a rank/id.

### List Items <li>
--> 1 single item of a list.


### data List <dl> (Description List)
--> To show sectioned data.

### dt -> Description Title (Description Term)
--> This is used to give the title of the category (Grouping).

### dd -> Description Data (Descrition Detail)
--> Used to give the specific detail for that category or group.

Task 2:
--> Create your grocery list using dl.
--> Divide into cat. like Meat, Breads, Fruits.


### table
--> Is like a wrapper. It tells the browser that a table is starting.

### thead (table head)
--> This is for the header of the table.

### tbody (table body)

### Attributes
--> These are additional things that you can put in your tags. They can give additional looks/functionalities to your elements.
--> Attributes are ALWAYS written in the opening tag.

### img (Image)
--> Used to display an image.

### website vs Webpage
--> A webpage is a single HTML page whereas a website is a collection of HTML pages.

### Anchor <a>
--> This is used to refer (redirect) the user to another page. That can be anywhere, on your website, or someone else's website, or any part of the internet.
Use href to give the destination.

Task 1:
--> Create your About me page (use image) and make the one made in the session.

Task 2:
--> Use table tag and create a page looking like a calendar

Task 3:
--> Create an invoice using table tag.
Hint: To achieve this, you can either do nesting of Tables OR read about rowspan and colspan attributes.

For all of them, I expect them to be hosted online.
