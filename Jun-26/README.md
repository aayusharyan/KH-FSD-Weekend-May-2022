- JavaScript is added at the last.
- For single line comments. We use //
- For multi line comments, we use /* for opening and */ for closing.

## Data types in JS
1. Boolean
2. Number
3. String
4. undefined
5. Null
6. Object
7. Symbol
8. BigInt

**In JS, we don't have arrays, we basically use custom object to represent an array.**


## Conditional
if (<condition>) {
  // Lines of code. 
}
else if 
else

### Nesting
- One type of logic inside another of the same.

## Number as a data type
- Mathematical number

## boolean as a data type.
- Can store either true or false.

## While Loop
- while(<condition>) {
  //Lines of code
}

**In JS, arrays are special type of Object**
- let blahblah = [2, 5, 10, 15, -8, 24, "something", false, 4.5];
blahblah[3];
- Heterogenous -> Mixed.
- In JS, the arrays can have multiple datatypes of elements in them.


## Fot loop
- This loop requires 3 things, initialization, condition and inc/dec
for(<initialization>; <condition>; <inc/dec>) {

}


## String
- It is denoted in quotation marks. Anything "" or '' is a string.
- String is an array of characters.

## String concatenation
- Addition of strings. Operator is +
- "Aayush" + "Sinha" -> "AayushSinha"
- "Aayush" + " " + "Sinha" -> "Aayush Sinha"





Task 1 - Assume a number and check whether it is a prime number or not.
Task 2 - Assume an array of numbers and print the SECOND LARGEST number of that array.
Task 3 - Assume an array of names(string) and print the name with most number of vowels.
Task 4 - Assume a number and print the factorial of that number.
Example: 10 -> 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 => 3628800
Task 5 - Print the FizzBuzz Series from 1 to 100.
